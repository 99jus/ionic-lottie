# Ionic Lottie Sample

![Example](https://github.com/yannbf/ionic-lottie/blob/master/sample-gif.gif?raw=true)

This is a sample project that uses [ng-lottie](https://github.com/chenqingspring/ng-lottie) to display animations provided by a json in ionic 3.

To run it:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yannbf/ionic-lottie.git
cd ionic-lottie
npm i
ionic serve
```


ps: Take note that this sample has too many animations running at once for sampling purposes only. 
If you would like to run on a device, remove a few of these animations to have them running smoothly.

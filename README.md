# Ionic Lottie Sample

![Example](https://github.com/yannbf/ionic-lottie/blob/master/sample-gif.gif?raw=true)

This is a sample project that uses [ng-lottie](https://github.com/chenqingspring/ng-lottie) to display animations provided by an after effects animation json in ionic 3.

For usage/docs, refer to [ng-lottie repo](https://github.com/chenqingspring/ng-lottie)

To run it:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/yannbf/ionic-lottie.git
cd ionic-lottie
npm i
ionic serve
```

ps: Take note that this sample has too many animations running at once for sampling purposes only.
If you would like to run on a device, remove a few of these animations to have them running smoothly.

All animations were acquired from codepen as well as lottie repo as samples to test.
None of those belong to me, they belong to http://codepen.io/svgsprite/, http://codepen.io/airnan/ and https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android.
